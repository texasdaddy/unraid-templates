"""The four surfaces the leak-guard ENGINE was blind to, and the plant-and-measure for each.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
    `scripts/check_no_internal_info.py` is the fleet's shared guard: every other repository takes
    a copy of it, so a gap here is a gap everywhere at once. Four were measured against
    `main@046fc7e` (`_sessions/unraid-templates/AUDIT.md`, 2026-08-29), and every one of them
    exited 0 on content that a push would have published permanently:

      keystone#20  A PATH was read by nothing. A tracked `<rfc1918-addr>.conf`, or a
                   `docs/<host>.lan/` directory, with perfectly clean file CONTENT, passed both
                   scans. A filename is rendered on every GitHub file listing and lands in every
                   clone. (The `<host>.lan-runbook/` spelling is NOT caught and never was — the
                   `.lan` bound rejects a following hyphen. It is pinned as a stated limit by
                   `test_the_path_scan_INHERITS_the_patterns_LIMITS_and_says_so`, which is where
                   the claim and the behaviour are kept in agreement.)
      #39/keystone#21  The range scan read a commit's IDENTITY (`%an%ae%cn%ce`) and its DIFF, and
                   nothing else. A leak written into a commit MESSAGE — or into an annotated tag's
                   name, tagger or message — was published and reported clean.
      #33/keystone#23  The pre-commit layer read the WORKTREE. `git add` a leak, tidy the worktree
                   without re-staging, and the hook exits 0 while the commit records the leak.
      keystone#22  `SKIP_SUFFIXES` was trusted outright, so an ASCII runbook named `.pdf` was read
                   by neither scan; and a run that scanned ZERO files printed the same cheerful
                   "no internal info found" a real clean run prints.

    The tests below fall into TWO kinds, and only the first is a reproduction:

      * the CATCH tests — each is one of the gaps above, committed. Each FAILS against the engine
        as it was and PASSES against the engine as it is, which is what makes it the anti-rot
        check for its issue: if a future edit reopens the gap, this is what says so.
      * the FALSE-RED tests — `test_an_ordinary_or_allow_listed_path_is_not_a_finding`,
        `test_an_ORDINARY_commit_message_does_not_block_a_push`, `test_a_tag_THIS_PUSH_DOES_NOT_
        SEND_is_NOT_scanned`, `test_the_floor_does_not_*`, and the control halves generally. These
        pass against BOTH engines by construction — the old one scanned neither surface, so it
        could not false-red on it. They are not reproductions of the four gaps; they are the
        regression tests for the SECOND round of defects, where the fixes above reddened trees
        that leak nothing (a machine-local override filename, a message naming one, a scratch tag,
        an `rm` of a tracked image, an empty repository). Saying so matters because "every test
        here fails against the old engine" is the kind of claim this file exists to keep out.

⚠️ EVERY LEAKING LITERAL HERE IS ASSEMBLED AT RUNTIME, exactly as in
    `test_leak_guard_range.py`, and every one is synthetic. This file is scanned by the guard —
    only `scripts/check_no_internal_info.py` is exempt — so a deny case written out whole would
    make the guard fail on its own test suite.

⚠️ EVERY `git` CALL PINS ITS CONFIG. A test that inherits the machine's git config is the
    config-dependent sibling of a time-bomb test: the CI runner has no `user.email`, so a
    `git commit` that needs one silently no-ops there and a test whose SETUP no-ops passes
    VACUOUSLY while looking like coverage. Identity, signing and autocrlf are all pinned, and the
    plants are re-read from git before anything is asserted about them.
