"""The leak guard must scan the COMMITS being pushed, not just the working tree.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
    `scripts/check_no_internal_info.py` scanned `git ls-files` and nothing else. That answers
    "is the leak here NOW", and it has two blind spots that a push turns permanent:

    1. A BRAND-NEW FILE IS NOT TRACKED YET. `git ls-files` lists the index, so a file that has
       not been `git add`ed is not scanned, not reported unreadable, and not counted — it is
       simply absent from the run that prints "no internal info found". Run the guard before
       staging and it clears a tree that does not contain the very file you just wrote. That is
       how a synthetic internal hostname reached a public remote.
    2. A VALUE COMMITTED AND THEN DELETED is absent from the tree too, and stays permanently
       readable at the commit that added it once the branch reaches the remote.

    Both are recoverable only by a history rewrite and a force-push across every clone.

    `test_a_leak_in_a_BRAND_NEW_UNTRACKED_file_...` and
    `test_a_leak_added_then_deleted_...` are the tests that would have caught them. Each
    asserts BOTH halves — the tree scan's blindness AND the range scan closing it — so they
    fail if the range scan is removed and they document why the tree scan alone was never
    enough.

SHAPE
    The diff PARSING is a pure function (`parse_diff`), so most of this runs with no repository
    at all. The tests that build a real repo do so because the claim is about real git history,
    and a synthetic diff would be assuming the thing under test. Those are slow on Windows — a
    commit costs seconds once a virus scanner is watching `.git` — so they carry explicit
    timeouts.

⚠️ EVERY LEAKING LITERAL HERE IS BUILT AT RUNTIME, and every one of them is synthetic
    (`.invalid` is reserved by RFC 2606; the addresses are implausible). Written out whole, they
    would make THIS FILE a finding of the very scanner it tests: the guard skips exactly one
    file, its own source, and the working-tree scan runs on every commit.

    ⭐ THE DENYLIST IS SHAPES ONLY, so there is no longer a real token for this file to avoid
    naming. It used to hold real values — first as plaintext, then base64-encoded — and both
    forms shipped those values in a public repo. They now live in a guard kept in the project
    working directory that is never committed anywhere, and that guard is what runs against the
    staged tree before every push.

    That relocation is why `test_guard_source_carries_no_plaintext_token` is gone: a repository
    that no longer knows the real tokens cannot assert their absence, and a test that pretended
    to would be checking nothing. What CAN be asserted from here is that no real-literal denylist
    has crept back in at all — see `test_the_guard_carries_no_real_literal_denylist` and
    `test_the_denylist_is_the_agreed_shape_set`, which pin the structure rather than the values.

# genuinely load-bearing while the guard still carried real values.
#
# It cannot survive the move to a shapes-only denylist, because it depended on the repo knowing
# the real tokens in order to look for them. The whole point of the change is that the repo does
# NOT know them any more: plaintext republished them, and base64 still shipped them one `b64decode`
# away. Keeping a version of that test would mean keeping the values here to test against, which
# is the leak it was written to detect.
#
# So the real-literal assertion moved OUT of this repository, to a guard in the project working
# directory that is never committed and is run against the staged tree before every push. What
# these two tests do instead is pin the STRUCTURE: no encoded table, no decoder, and exactly the
# agreed set of shape patterns. Neither can prove "no real value is present" — nothing inside a

# ROUND 2 — the three fail-opens the amnesty hardening never touched (#241, #242, #250).
#
# All three live in the diff-PARSING and DECODE code rather than in the pattern matching, and all
# three have the same shape: the guard reports CLEAN about something it never read. That is worse
# than a missed pattern, because the run says so explicitly.
#
#   #250  an external diff driver replaces git's output, so no header is recognised, every line
#         is dropped, and the range scan exits 0 on a real leak.
#   #241  the path is derived wrongly (a path containing " b/", a git-quoted path, or a trailing
#         space eaten by `.strip()`), so the re-diff matches nothing, git exits 0 empty, and the
#         file is reported clean instead of unscannable. One shape also handed an arbitrary file
#         the guard's single self-exemption.
#   #242  BOM-less UTF-16LE of ASCII is VALID UTF-8, so every decode site succeeded, the
#         NUL-separated content matched no pattern, and the file was COUNTED AS SCANNED.
