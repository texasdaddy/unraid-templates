# unraid-templates

Public Unraid Docker templates + icons for the self-hosted stack
(**Tape**, **CEF Tracker**, **Keystone**, **reauth-bot**). Public so Unraid can fetch icons
anonymously via `raw.githubusercontent.com`; the application source stays in its own
private repos.

## Icons
`icons/` holds 256×256 transparent PNGs. Reference them in a container's **Icon URL**:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdr-ventures/unraid-templates/main/icons/<name>.png
```

| Container | Icon | Template |
|---|---|---|
| tape (dev+prod) | `icons/tape.png` | `templates/tape.xml` |
| tape-db (dev+prod) | `icons/tape_db.png` | `templates/tape-db.xml` |
| cef-tracker (prod) | `icons/cef-tracker.png` | `templates/cef-tracker.xml` |
| reauth-bot | `icons/reauth_bot.png` | `templates/reauth-bot.xml` |
| keystone | `icons/keystone.png` | `templates/keystone.xml` |
| keystone-db | `icons/keystone_db.png` | `templates/keystone-db.xml` |
| keystone-web (dev+prod) | `icons/keystone-web.png` | `templates/keystone-web.xml` |
| the-desk (prod) | `icons/the-desk.png` | `templates/the-desk.xml` |
| gambit (prod) | `icons/gambit.png` | `templates/gambit.xml` |
| iron-tide | `icons/iron-tide.png` | `templates/iron-tide.xml` |
| tldw-redis (start 1st) | `icons/tldw-redis.png` | `templates/tldw-redis.xml` |
| tldw-server (start 2nd) | `icons/tldw-server.png` | `templates/tldw-server.xml` |
| tldw-webui (start 3rd, needs manual network-alias setup) | `icons/tldw-webui.png` | `templates/tldw-webui.xml` |

Every template + icon in this repo must have a row here — keep this table in sync when adding either (the reauth-bot icon was added 2026-07-25 but not listed until 2026-07-27). Scripts have their own manifest under [Scripts](#scripts); the same rule applies there.

## Templates
`templates/` holds the Unraid container templates (`<Icon>` pre-set). Secrets are blank
by design — fill them in Unraid on import.

**`sync-templates.py` is the only thing that carries a template change toward a container that already exists — and it carries it as far as that container's *saved template*, not into the container itself.** Stock Unraid never merges a template change into an existing container, and that is deliberate rather than a bug: in `emhttp/plugins/dynamix.docker.manager/include/DockerClient.php`, `updateUserTemplate()` opens with `// Don't update templates, but leave code in place for future reference` and returns — on every release from 6.12 to current. Its sibling `downloadTemplates()` became a no-op only in **7.3.0**; on 6.12.x—7.2.x it is live, so registering this repo in `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/template-repos` there really does mirror it into `templates-usb` and refresh the *Default templates* list — but that path only populates the Add Container list (and deletes templates it no longer finds); it never touches an existing `my-*.xml`. Templates from this repo appear under **Docker → Add Container** in the *User templates* group because `sync-templates.py` seeds a `my-<name>.xml` for each; `<TemplateURL>` earns its keep by letting that script map an instance back to its template. **So: edit a template here, run `sync-templates.py`, then open the container's Edit page and press Apply.** The script rewrites `my-<name>.xml`; the container is rebuilt from that file by Apply, and equally by any container **Update** or *force update* — but never on its own. "Check for update" compares the image only.

## Scripts

`scripts/` holds the repo's operational + CI tooling. Every script here must have a row:

| Script | What it is | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/sync-templates.py` | Reconciles the Unraid host's `my-*.xml` container templates against this repo | Unraid host, via **User Scripts** |

> **The leak guard is the pinned kw-common `v1.7.0` guard** — nothing is vendored here. CI runs it as the
> `leak-guard` job (the reusable `leak-guard.yml`); the local hooks are written into the git directory by
> `kw-leak-guard --install-hooks` from a venv outside the tracked tree (`.venv-guard/`, ignored); allowances,
> if ever needed, live in `.leakguard.json`. It matches shapes only, so a bare hostname, codename or
> personal name still has no shape and **green CI is not clearance**: that is the project-side guard's job.
>
> `main` carries branch protection requiring `leak-guard / No internal info (leak guard)`,
> `Leak-guard tests` and `Templates are well-formed XML`, with `enforce_admins` on and `strict` set.
> **A job's `name:` is the status-check context**: renaming one does not fail its check, the required
> context simply never reports and every PR sits BLOCKED with green jobs.

### `sync-templates.py`

No parameters. Each run does **create / update / drop-deprecated** for the one
managed container template in `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user` that
its `TEMPLATE` setting names, **keeping each instance's applied values**:

- **CREATE** — seeds `my-<name>.xml` for the template if it has no `my-` file yet, so it is ready to pick under *Add Container*.
- **UPDATE** — for **every live instance** of a template (for `tape`: `my-tape.xml` *and* `my-tape-dev.xml`, …; `my-tape-db-dev.xml` is `tape-db`'s): keeps that instance's applied value for each variable, refreshes the variable's metadata (description, defaults, visibility) from the repo template, and adds variables the template has gained.
- **DROP** — a variable the instance has and the repo template lacks is **deprecated and is dropped, whatever value it holds**. Each drop is named in the run output (`DROPPED, not in repo template (deprecated): NAME (held a value)`). The pre-sync backup (secrets redacted) is the only record of it.

**The rule.** The repo template is the schema: variables, ports and paths by name, with neutral defaults. The live instance is the values. A sync copies each applied live value into the matching repo variable and adopts the repo's metadata. Not in the repo template means deprecated, and the sync drops it. To retire a variable, remove it from the repo template. To add one, add it to the repo template first, let the sync bring it to the instance, then set its value there. A variable added to a live instance only is dropped by the next sync.

Container-level settings you set per instance — image tag, network/IP, WebUI, Extra
Params, ports, the container Name — are **always preserved**; only `<Config>`
elements are reconciled.

**A Path's Mode (Read/Write vs Read-only) is operator-owned, once an instance is
seeded** — a Mode you set on an existing instance survives every later sync even when
the template's own Mode changes; a template-side Mode change reaches a newly-seeded
`my-<name>.xml` only, never an instance that already exists. Every other attribute of
every Config, including a **Port's** tcp/udp Mode, keeps refreshing from the template
on every run.

Instances map to templates by their `<TemplateURL>` basename, falling back to the
longest dash-prefix of the filename — so `my-tape-db-dev.xml` maps to `tape-db`
and never to `tape`. Containers that came from anywhere else are never touched.

**One commit per run** (#103). A run first resolves `main` to its current commit and
reads the template listing and the template body at that commit, so a run right after
a merge cannot list the new templates and merge against a body a cache still serves
from before it. The first output line names the commit (`commit=<40-char sha>`).
GitHub caches the commit lookup itself for up to 60 s, so a run in the first minute
after a merge may still use the commit before it — consistently, listing and body
alike; check that line before relying on a just-merged change.
That costs two unauthenticated `api.github.com` requests per run (the commit and the
listing; the body comes from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, which is not counted), out
of GitHub's 60 per hour per IP. A run that hits the limit stops before writing
anything and says when to retry.

**Two constants at the top of the file are its only settings** — never a parameter:

| | |
|---|---|
| `TEMPLATE = None` | Not set: the run refuses before it reads or writes anything (exit non-zero, `Nothing changed.`). There is no run over every template (#102: it reconciled a `my-<name>.xml` against two templates). |
| `TEMPLATE = "tape"` | **Only** `templates/tape.xml` and its live instances. Nothing that maps to another template is created, updated, deleted, or has its backups redacted or pruned — `tape-db` included, because instances are mapped against the *full* template list before the scope is applied. The output's `scope:` line names the template, so a dry run shows the scope before a live run acts on it. **Refused before anything is written** (exit non-zero, `Nothing changed.`): a name the repo does not have; a `my-tape.xml` that is really a *different* template's instance (by its `<TemplateURL>`) or a foreign container — case variants of the name such as `my-Tape.xml` included, since `/boot` is FAT32 — so fix that file's `<TemplateURL>` or rename the container; and a templates dir that cannot be listed. |
| `DRY_RUN = True` | Prints exactly what it *would* create/update/drop. Writes nothing. |
| `DRY_RUN = False` | Performs the changes. Every overwritten file is backed up first (timestamped, under `templates-user/.template-sync-backups/`), writes are atomic, and a merged result is validated before it replaces the original. |

The committed copy is live but unset (`DRY_RUN = False`, `TEMPLATE = None`), so it
refuses until a copy names its template.
To validate a change first, flip `DRY_RUN` to `True`, run it, review the output, then
flip it back.

**One installed User Script per template.** Syncing one template must not ship every
*other* template's merged-but-not-yet-intended changes, so the host runs one copy per
repo template — each **identical to the repo copy except for its `TEMPLATE` line**.
A template added to the repo later gets its own copy then; no per-template copy seeds it.

A backup whose instance is gone, is not a repo template's (a foreign container, or a
template since removed from the repo), or cannot be read belongs to no template —
except the backups of a template's own `my-<name>.xml`, which are that template's
(unless that file maps to another template, in which case its run refuses). No
per-template copy redacts, prunes or reports an orphan, even one that cannot be parsed.
Every backup this script writes is already redacted, so such an orphan holds a secret
only if it predates #27 or was dropped there by hand. Delete orphans by hand: in
`templates-user/.template-sync-backups/`, remove the backups whose `my-*.xml` is gone
or no longer synced — but keep those of a `my-*.xml` that cannot be read, since they
are how you restore it.

> **Backups redact your `Mask="true"` values** (#27). `Mask="true"` is a *UI* setting —
> it makes the Unraid form render a password box, but the XML on the flash drive
> holds the value in **plaintext**. Backups used to be byte-for-byte copies, so
> every run left another cleartext copy of every token and PAT on the drive, and
> nothing pruned them.
>
> Now a backup is written with every masked value replaced by `***REDACTED***`,
> the **first run also redacts the backups earlier versions already wrote**, and
> backups are pruned to the newest `KEEP_BACKUPS` (10) per instance. A `.bak`
> that cannot be parsed is *reported by name and left alone* by the run that owns
> it (an orphan has no owning run; see orphans above) — it may still hold a secret,
> so review and delete those by hand.
>
> **What this costs a restore:** the structure and every non-secret value come
> back in full (except a mirror entry with no `<Config>`, redacted as unknown); a
> masked value must be re-entered. That is not much of a loss —
> `merge()` copies applied values across verbatim, so a merge cannot damage a
> secret; the backup is there in case a *merge* goes wrong.
>
> `DRY_RUN = True` covers all of this: it reports what it would redact and prune
> and writes nothing.
>
> **What is redacted, stated exactly** — a `<Config>` that is `Mask="true"` in the
> instance file **or in the repo template** (#104: a live file can hold a secret with
> `Mask="false"`), and the `<Environment><Variable><Value>` mirror dockerMan writes for
> the same variable. The same rule applies to the backups earlier runs left. A mirror
> entry with no `<Config>` of its name is redacted too, since nothing says it is safe;
> and a sync drops a mirror entry the repo template has no variable for, along with
> the `<Config>` it mirrored (`DROPPED legacy <Environment> mirror, not in repo template: NAME`).
> A secret passed some other way is **not** covered and never claimed to be: most
> importantly anything you typed into **`<Extra Parameters>`** (e.g.
> `-e TOKEN=...`), which is free text with no `Mask` flag to key on. Keep secrets
> in masked variables, not in Extra Parameters.

**Install as Unraid User Scripts, one per template:** for each file in `templates/`,
*Settings → User Utilities → User Scripts → Add New Script*, name it
`sync-templates-<name>` (e.g. `sync-templates-tape`), paste the file in as the script
body, and change **only** its `TEMPLATE` line to `TEMPLATE = "<name>"` (and `DRY_RUN`
while you rehearse — see above). Run it with *Run Script* (leave it unscheduled — it
is a deliberate, on-demand action, not a cron job). When the script changes, re-paste
every copy and re-set each one's `TEMPLATE` line. A copy left at `TEMPLATE = None`
refuses to run. An older single `sync-templates` copy whose `TEMPLATE = None` still runs every
template (#102): delete it. Requires python3 ≥ 3.9; stdlib
only, no dependencies to install.
