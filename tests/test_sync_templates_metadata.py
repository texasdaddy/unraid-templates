"""`sync-templates.py`: what it must write, what it must NOT write, and what it must SAY.

Two bugs in one week made this file necessary, and they are the same shape twice over —
`merge()` computed the right answer and `update_instance` threw part of it away because the
gate on the write asked the wrong question.

1. The gate was ``st["added"] or st["deleted"] or st["kept_flag"]``, so a template edit that
   changed only a field's Description, Default, Display or Required was discarded. Every
   operator-facing instruction in this repo lives in a `Description`, so the one edit the
   templates exist to deliver was the one edit that could not arrive.
2. Comparing content instead fixed that and broke the drift alarm: a variable the template
   no longer defines but which still holds a value is copied *verbatim* into `merged`, so the
   trees compare equal while `kept_flag` is non-empty. The `!! KEPT` line — which three
   separate documents promise is loud, and which is a migration checklist's only pointer to
   a mapping the operator must delete by hand — went silent on every run after the first.

So the assertions below cover the whole surface, not just the bug of the day: writes,
non-writes, the reported drift, the backup, and delete-as-necessary. Each one was checked by
mutating `sync-templates.py` and confirming it goes red.
