"""Every template in this repo, held to the properties a PUBLIC Unraid template must have.

These rules began life in `test_tldw_templates.py`, written for one two-container set, and
none of them was specific to it: a credential field that ships a working default, an image
reference that moves under an Update, a `Default=` attribute that disagrees with the element
text, an icon the README does not list — each is a defect in ANY template here, and each is
silently undone by an edit that looks like tidying. Issue #57 asked for them to be lifted so
they are enforced by CI over `templates/*.xml` rather than by review. The tl;dw file keeps
only what is genuinely about that set (its start order, its wiring, its cookie posture).

Nothing here is caught by the leak guard (these are not internal values) or by the XML job
(the file still parses either way), which is why it is caught here.

⚠️ ASSERT ON `Target`, NEVER ON `Name` ALONE. `Name` is the label Unraid draws beside the
field; `Target` is the string that becomes the environment variable. Keying on `Name` let a
mutation that re-pointed a server-side key at a browser-visible variable pass a whole suite.

⚠️ RULES BY SHAPE, NOT BY ROSTER. A hardcoded list of credential fields leaves the next one
unguarded on the day it is added. The credential rules are driven by the shape of the
variable name, with a small named exception set for the false positives.

⭐ A `<Config>` CARRIES ITS VALUE TWICE — the `Default="…"` attribute AND the element text.
An edit that updates one and not the other is half a change, and which half Unraid honours
is not something to discover in production. The agreement is asserted on every Config.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM, so that a guard implying coverage it lacks does not ship:
  * The icon rule proves an icon CAN carry transparency, not that any pixel is transparent.
  * Nothing here runs a container, reads an image or checks that an application actually
    READS a variable. Whether a field is inert is established against the application's
    source, by hand, when a template is written or audited.
  * The exceptions below (a privileged runner, a rolling database tag, a Redis command line)
    are DECISIONS recorded as data, each with the reason beside it. Adding to one of those
    sets is the cheap way to make this file pass; it is also how a decision gets made
    without being noticed, so every entry carries the why.
