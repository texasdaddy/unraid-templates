"""The tl;dw template set: the properties that are about THIS set, asserted rather than read.

This set is two templates that must agree with each other — a start order Unraid cannot
enforce, a Redis address the operator has to wire by hand, a session-cookie flag whose value
is a decision — and each of those is one attribute in an XML file that an edit which looks
like tidying silently undoes.

Everything that is true of ANY template here — credential fields shipping blank and masked,
an image reference that cannot move, `Default=` agreeing with the element text, the icon
and README rules, the privilege posture — used to live in this file and now lives in
`test_template_invariants.py`, which runs over every `templates/*.xml` (issue #57). This
file keeps only what is genuinely tl;dw's. None of it is caught by the leak guard (these are
not internal values) or by the XML job (the file still parses).

⚠️ ASSERT ON `Target`, NEVER ON `Name` ALONE — `Target` is the string that becomes the
environment variable; `Name` is only the label Unraid draws beside the field.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM:
  * The Overview disclosures are asserted as SUBSTRINGS. An Overview could contain every
    required phrase inside a sentence that negates it. Substring matching makes silent
    deletion impossible; it does not make the prose true. Read the Overview.
  * Nothing here runs a container. Whether the image behaves as the descriptions say was
    established by reading upstream at the pinned commit, and is recorded in the templates'
    own comments.
