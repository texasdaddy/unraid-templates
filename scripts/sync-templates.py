sync-templates — reconcile Unraid dockerMan container templates against the
published `unraid-templates` repo WITHOUT losing your applied values.

NO PARAMETERS, NO WRAPPER. Running it does create / update / delete-as-necessary
across the managed container templates that TEMPLATE (below) selects:

  TEMPLATE = None     every repo template and all their instances (the full pass).
  TEMPLATE = "tape"   ONLY the `tape` repo template and its live instances. Nothing
                      that maps to another template is created, updated, deleted,
                      or has its backups redacted or pruned — `tape-db` included,
                      since instances are mapped against the FULL template list
                      (see MAPPING below). Refused before anything is written: a
                      name the repo does not have, and a my-tape.xml that is
                      really another template's instance or a foreign container
                      (case variants of the name, e.g. my-Tape.xml, included).
                      A backup whose instance is gone (other than my-tape.xml's),
                      unmapped or unreadable is left to the full pass.

  ONE USER SCRIPT PER TEMPLATE: each installed copy is identical to this file
  apart from its TEMPLATE line, so syncing one template can never ship another
  template's merged-but-not-intended changes. The repo copy is the full pass.

  CREATE  — seed my-<name>.xml for any repo template that has no my- file yet,
            so it is ready to pick in Add Container.
  UPDATE  — for EVERY live instance of a template (tape: my-tape.xml AND
            my-tape-dev.xml, ...; my-tape-db-dev.xml is tape-db's): keep each
            instance's applied values, refresh each variable's metadata from the
            template, and ADD new template vars.
  DELETE  — drop a variable the template removed ONLY when it is genuinely unused
            (blank or still at its default). A removed variable that still holds a
            real, non-default value is KEPT and loudly flagged — that almost always
            means the TEMPLATE is missing it (drift), not that you wanted it gone.
  Container-level settings you set per instance — image tag, network/IP, WebUI,
  Extra Params, ports, the container Name — are ALWAYS preserved. Only <Config>
  elements are reconciled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRY-RUN vs LIVE  —  the DRY_RUN constant below is the switch.
  * DRY_RUN = True   prints exactly what it WOULD create/update/delete, writes
                     nothing. This is the version you validate.
  * DRY_RUN = False  performs the changes (each overwritten file is backed up
                     first, timestamped, under templates-user/.template-sync-backups/;
                     writes are atomic; a result is validated before it replaces
                     the original).

BACKUPS AND SECRETS  (unraid-templates#27)
  `Mask="true"` is a UI setting only -- it makes the Unraid web form render a
  password box. The XML on the flash drive holds the value in PLAINTEXT either
  way. So a backup is written with every masked value REDACTED, and the first
  run also redacts the backups previous versions already wrote. Backups are
  pruned to the newest KEEP_BACKUPS per instance.

  What that means for a restore: the structure and every non-secret value come
  back in full; a masked value must be re-entered. It is not a real loss --
  merge() copies applied values across verbatim, so a merge cannot damage a
  secret, and the backup is there for a bad merge.
  Workflow: run the dry-run version -> review -> when it is correct, install the
  version with DRY_RUN = False. Never a parameter; a copy differs from this file
  only in its TEMPLATE line (and DRY_RUN while you rehearse).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTANCE -> TEMPLATE MAPPING
  Primary: the instance's <TemplateURL> basename (my-tape-dev.xml -> tape.xml).
  Fallback: longest dash-prefix of the filename (my-tape-db-dev.xml -> tape-db,
  never tape; my-tapeworm.xml -> nothing). Foreign containers are never touched.

REQUIRES  python3 >= 3.9 (stdlib only). Run on the Unraid host via User Scripts.

#
# `Mask="true"` is a UI affordance ONLY — it tells the Unraid web form to render the field as a
# password box. The XML on the flash drive stores the value in PLAINTEXT regardless. So the old
# `shutil.copy2` backup wrote a byte-for-byte cleartext copy of every API token, PAT and password
# in the instance, and did it on EVERY write, and never pruned. A flash drive that anyone with
# physical access can read then accumulated one more cleartext copy of each secret per run.
#
# The backup exists to recover from a bad merge, and the value of a secret is not what it
# recovers: `merge()` copies every applied value across VERBATIM (`new_c.text = op_by_key[k].text`)
# and keeps a template-removed variable verbatim too, so a merge cannot corrupt a secret in the
# first place. What a restore actually needs is the STRUCTURE and the non-secret values, and those
# are preserved in full. A masked value is re-entered from wherever it came from.
